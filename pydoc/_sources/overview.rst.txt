Overview
========

The Elasticsearch DXL Python client library provides a high level wrapper for
invoking the
`Elasticsearch REST APIs <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html>`_
via the
[Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)
(DXL) fabric.

This client requires the
`Elasticsearch DXL Service <https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-elasticsearch-service-python>`_
to be running and available on the DXL fabric.
